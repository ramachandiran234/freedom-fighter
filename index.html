            <td><p>Veerapandiya as a polygar retained the right to collect taxes and recruit soldiers in his domain, the British viewed the polygars as illegitimate rulers and wanted to end their taxation powers, and curtail their power and influence. To this end they introduced a new tax policy through which they intended to completely bypass the polygars and other intermediaries during tax collection.[6] Kattabomman saw this as an attempt to usurp his sovereignty over his domain by the British and stopped paying them tributes contending that his taxes ought to be waived due to the prolonged drought in his domain whilst fighting against polygars allied with the British.

                In 1798 Kattabomman and the then Tirunelveli collector Jackson got into a disagreement over left over taxes, when Kattabomman was able to meet with Jackson three months later in Ramnathapuram, where there was an altercation between company troops and the polygar resulting in the death of the deputy commandant of the company's forces Clarke, Kattabomman was acquitted from this following an inquiry. In 1799 following his refusal to meet with the collector, the British sent an armed force under Major. John Alexander Bannerman.[8]</p></td>

            <td><p>Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj. The early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing nationalism as a higher calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism.[i] Bose became Congress president in 1938. After reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of British India and princely states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for himself.[15] After the large majority of the Congress Working Committee members resigned in protest,[16] Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from the party.[17][18]</p></td>
